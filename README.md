# TitanCrawler

## Overview

**TitanCrawler** is a robust, multi-threaded web crawler designed for efficient and ethical web scraping. Built with Python, it incorporates advanced features such as concurrency, respect for `robots.txt`, user-agent rotation, and comprehensive logging. TitanCrawler is ideal for developers and data enthusiasts who need a powerful tool to crawl websites responsibly.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Crawling**: Utilize multiple threads to speed up the crawling process without overloading target servers.
- **Respect for Robots.txt**: Automatically parses and respects the `robots.txt` file of websites to ensure ethical crawling.
- **User-Agent Rotation**: Randomly rotates user-agents from a customizable list to reduce the chance of being blocked.
- **Error Handling & Retry Mechanism**: Robust error handling with retries for transient failures.
- **Depth-Limited Search**: Configurable crawling depth to control the scope of the crawl.
- **Delay Between Requests**: Implements polite crawling by adding delays between requests.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of crawling activities, errors, and warnings.
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily adjust crawler behavior through the `config.ini` file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/TitanCrawler.git
   cd TitanCrawler
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Configure TitanCrawler by editing the `config.ini` file:

```ini
[CRAWLER_SETTINGS]
url = https://example.com
max_depth = 3
max_workers = 5
delay = 1.0
log_file = logs/crawl.log
```

- **url**: The starting URL for the crawler.
- **max_depth**: Maximum depth to crawl (integer).
- **max_workers**: Number of threads to use (integer).
- **delay**: Delay between requests in seconds (float).
- **log_file**: File path for logs.

### User Agents

Add user-agent strings to `user_agents.txt` for rotation:

```plaintext
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ...
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) ...
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) ...
```

## Usage

Run the crawler with:

```bash
python crawler.py
```

The crawler will start crawling from the URL specified in `config.ini` and adhere to the settings provided.

### Output

- **Console Output**: Displays each successfully crawled URL.
- **Log File**: Detailed logs are saved to the file specified in `config.ini` (default is `logs/crawl.log`).
